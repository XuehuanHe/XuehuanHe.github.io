## Data-driven approaches for discovering macroscopic rupture pattern of ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (ATAA) based on early response features
It is known that the rupture of an aneurysm tissue begins at a certain local region, and then the crack continues to propagate under loading. According to classical macro-mechanical failure theory, rupture of the tissue occurs when the stress in the tissue exceeds the material strength. It is known that ATAA tissue exhibit significant inter-subject and intro-subject heterogeneity.  A reliable rupture risk assessment of ATAA thus requires knowledge of the stress and strength, both local. However, there is no viable experiment which enables the acquisition of the local failure properties for ATAA tissue, which inhibits the accurate estimation of the tissue local rupture risk. When I first explored this area, I realized that even the most obvious questions do not have very clear answers, such as, "Are the tissue response properties manifested in the crack initiation area different from surrounding intact regions?" and "If so, could we differentiate between rupture and non-rupture groups based on response features?" To answer these questions, I developed a novel, data-driven approach to differentiate macroscopic response patterns between rupture and non-rupture groups. To facilitate the application of this method in vivo, only tension-strain curves within the physiological blood pressure range were selected. It is hypothesized that the region prone to initiate rupture is associated with a high level of stress (tension) build-up. The results suggest that the proposed “stress (tension) build-up level” within the physiological pressure range can be exploited to estimate the rupture risk of ATAA. This work has shown promising results and may eventually pave the way for noninvasively assessing ATAA rupture risk.

## Constitutive Modeling of Vascular Tissue considering collagen recruitment 
Our data-driven approach implies that patterns observed during the transitional phase of response can be exploited to evaluate the rupture risk in aortic aneurysms. The transitional phase arises due to the gradual recruitment of crimped collagen fibers. In our work, we introduced an 'effective stretch' to account for collagen recruitment. It is a continuum-scale kinematic variable measuring, in an average sense, the uncrimped stretch of collagen fibers at the tissue level. In light of the effective stretch, we developed a family of constitutive models to describe the uniaxial and biaxial responses of vascular tissue. The models demonstrate excellent descriptive and predictive capabilities

## A strain based rupture metric for ATAA that emphasizes micro-structural connection

We advocated the use of effective strain in ATAA rupture assessment. The effective strain is a measure of net strain in the collagen network after waviness uncrimping. We analyzed bulge inflation data of ATAA samples. It was found that, while the total strains at rupture varied from sample to sample, the effective strains were closely clustered around 0.1. And the hotspots of effective strain matched the rupture sites well. The work underlines the importance of considering collagen fiber waviness and recruitment when evaluating the rupture risk using strain and suggests a new direction for developing sharper rupture metrics

## Modeling of the Interaction between Colon and Colonoscope during a Colonoscopy

We simulated the insertion process of colonoscopes in colon models via ANSYS-LSDYNA. An uni-axial tension test was carried out to provide the mechanical properties of a porcine colon. The model developed in this project serves as a starting point in understanding the efficacy of SC colonoscopes in reducing patient pain considering the effects of patient characteristics, including gender, age, and region.
