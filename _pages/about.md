About Me
======

 I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the laboratory of Ocular Biomechanics at the University of Pittsburgh (Mentor: Dr. Ian A. Sigal). Previously, I worked as a Postdoc Reseacher at the University of Michigan (Mentors: Dr. Nicholas Burris and Dr. Alberto Figueroa) from 2022 to 2023. I received my Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering from University of Iowa (advisor: Dr. Jia Lu), in 2022. Before that, I obtained a M.S. degree from University of Minnesota, Duluth, in 2018 and a B.Eng. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Chang'an University,China, in 2015.

My research interests mostly lie in the the field of fibrous soft tissue biomechanics. I am very interested in understanding the relations between fibrous soft tissue microstructural properties, macroscopic mechanical properties and diseases using a systematic framework consisting of ex vivo mechanical tests, medical image processing, computational modeling, multiscale modeling and machine learning techniques.
