# Research Summary

## Data-driven approaches for discovering macroscopic rupture pattern of ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (ATAA) based on early response features
It is known that the rupture of an aneurysm tissue begins at a certain local region, and then the crack continues to propagate under loading. According to classical macro-mechanical failure theory, rupture of the tissue occurs when the stress in the tissue exceeds the material strength. It is known that ATAA tissue exhibit significant inter-subject and intro-subject heterogeneity.  A reliable rupture risk assessment of ATAA thus requires knowledge of the stress and strength, both local. However, there is no viable experiment which enables the acquisition of the local failure properties for ATAA tissue, which inhibits the accurate estimation of the tissue local rupture risk. When I first explored this area, I realized that even the most obvious questions do not have very clear answers, such as, "Are the tissue response properties manifested in the crack initiation area different from surrounding intact regions?" and "If so, could we differentiate between rupture and non-rupture groups based on response features?" To answer these questions, I developed a novel, data-driven approach to differentiate macroscopic response patterns between rupture and non-rupture groups. To facilitate the application of this method in vivo, only tension-strain curves within the physiological blood pressure range were selected. It is hypothesized that the region prone to initiate rupture is associated with a high level of stress (tension) build-up. The results suggest that the proposed “stress (tension) build-up level” within the physiological pressure range can be exploited to estimate the rupture risk of ATAA. This work has shown promising results and may eventually pave the way for noninvasively assessing ATAA rupture risk.

## Constitutive Modeling of Vascular Tissue considering collagen recruitment 
Our data-driven approach implies that patterns observed during the transitional phase of response can be exploited to evaluate the rupture risk in aortic aneurysms. The transitional phase arises due to the gradual recruitment of crimped collagen fibers. In our work, we introduced an 'effective stretch' to account for collagen recruitment. It is a continuum-scale kinematic variable measuring, in an average sense, the uncrimped stretch of collagen fibers at the tissue level. In light of the effective stretch, we developed a family of constitutive models to describe the uniaxial and biaxial responses of vascular tissue. The models demonstrate excellent descriptive and predictive capabilities
